Developer FAQ
=============

This section addresses common questions and hurdles encountered when developing 
with the ecosystem.

How do I run the full CI suite locally?
---------------------------------------

You can use ``gh act`` to emulate GitHub Actions on your machine. This is 
useful for catching environment-specific bugs before pushing code. 
See :ref:`devdoc-local-ci` for setup and usage instructions.

.. note::

  These can be rather heavy for users without workstations. Using
  ``--action-offline-mode`` after the first run will help.

How do I run just the NumPy < 2.0 tests?
----------------------------------------

When using ``gh act``, you can isolate specific matrix configurations by 
specifying the matrix keys. To run the legacy NumPy tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    gh act -j python-tests \
      --matrix os:ubuntu-24.04 \
      --matrix python-version:3.10 \
      --matrix torch-version:2.1 \
      --matrix numpy-version-pin:"<2.0"

How do I run a single tox environment in CI?
--------------------------------------------

If you are using ``act`` and want to skip the full suite in favor of a 
single environment (e.g., ``core-tests``), pass the ``TOXENV`` 
variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    gh act -j python-tests --env TOXENV=core-tests

How do I make a new release?
----------------------------

Follow a release PR. Find more `here <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+release+is%3Aclosed>`_.

.. note::

  The changelog files are managed by hand.

How do I handle new PyTorch versions?

How do I organize my commits for a Pull Request?
------------------------------------------------

We prefer a clean history with logical commits. If your branch has many small
"fixup" or "wip" commits, you should squash them into a meaningful history.

.. note::

  This process is optional, if the changes are related to a single concept, we
  default to squashing during the merge.

- **Interactive Rebase**: To combine the last ``N`` commits, use:

  .. code-block:: bash

      git rebase -i HEAD~N

- **Soft Reset (The "Atomic" Method)**: If the history is too messy to rebase, reset to the main branch and re-add everything as logical blocks:

  .. code-block:: bash

      git reset --soft upstream/main
      git add -p  # selectively add changes
      git commit -m "logical commit message"
