Developer FAQ
=============

This section addresses common questions and hurdles encountered when developing
with the ecosystem.

How do I use environment variables to control tests?
----------------------------------------------------

The ``tox`` configuration supports several environment variables to customize
test execution. Setting these directly in your shell provides a less hermetic
but much lighter way to approximate the configurations found in the :ref:`devdoc-local-ci`
without the overhead of Docker containers.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - ``METATENSOR_TESTS_TORCH_VERSION``
     - Sets the ``torch`` version (e.g., ``"2.2"``).
   * - ``METATENSOR_TESTS_NUMPY_VERSION_PIN``
     - Pins the ``numpy`` version (e.g., ``"<2.0"``).
   * - ``PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL``
     - Provides an additional URL to find packages (e.g., for CPU-only torch).
   * - ``METATENSOR_BUILD_TYPE``
     - Set to ``release`` to compile Rust components with optimizations.

.. important::

   When running ``tox`` locally, your host Python version must be compatible
   with the ``torch`` version you request. For example, some versions of
   ``torch`` do not support Python 3.14.

If you encounter dependency resolution errors, ensure you are using a compatible
Python interpreter. You can use ``tox`` within a specific Python environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Use the -x flag to override the base_python for the environment
    METATENSOR_TESTS_TORCH_VERSION="2.2" \
    METATENSOR_TESTS_NUMPY_VERSION_PIN="<2.0" \
    tox -e core-tests -x testenv:core-tests.base_python=python3.11

How do I run the full CI suite locally?
---------------------------------------

You can use ``gh act`` to emulate GitHub Actions on your machine. This is
useful for catching environment-specific bugs before pushing code.
See :ref:`devdoc-local-ci` for setup and usage instructions.

.. note::

   These can be rather heavy for users without workstations. Using
   ``--action-offline-mode`` after the first run will help.

How do I run just the NumPy < 2.0 tests?
----------------------------------------

When using ``gh act``, you can isolate specific matrix configurations by
specifying the matrix keys. To run the legacy NumPy tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    gh act -j python-tests \
      --matrix os:ubuntu-24.04 \
      --matrix python-version:3.10 \
      --matrix torch-version:2.1 \
      --matrix numpy-version-pin:"<2.0"

.. tip::

   If you don't need the full Docker isolation of ``act``, you can also 
   replicate this legacy environment using :ref:`the environment variables method <devdoc-faq-env-vars>`.

How do I run a single tox environment in CI?
--------------------------------------------

If you are using ``act`` and want to skip the full suite in favor of a
single environment (e.g., ``core-tests``), pass the ``TOXENV``
variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    gh act -j python-tests --env TOXENV=core-tests

How do I make a new release?
----------------------------

Follow a release PR. Find more `here <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+release+is%3Aclosed>`_.

.. note::

   The changelog files are managed by hand.

How do I handle new PyTorch versions?
-------------------------------------

Follow a PyTorch upgrade PR. Then make a new release.

   * - Complexity
     - Example
   * - Baseline version changes

   * - Handling deprecations
     - `v2.10 <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/pull/1041>`_

How do I organize my commits for a Pull Request?
------------------------------------------------

We prefer a clean history with logical commits. If your branch has many small
"fixup" or "wip" commits, you should squash them into a meaningful history.

.. note::

   This process is optional; if the changes are related to a single concept, we
   default to squashing during the merge.

- **Interactive Rebase**: To combine the last ``N`` commits, use:

  .. code-block:: bash

      git rebase -i HEAD~N

- **Soft Reset (The "Atomic" Method)**: If the history is too messy to rebase, reset to the main branch and re-add everything as logical blocks:

  .. code-block:: bash

      git reset --soft upstream/main
      git add -p  # selectively add changes
      git commit -m "logical commit message"
